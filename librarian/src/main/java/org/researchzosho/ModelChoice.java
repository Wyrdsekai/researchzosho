 * Which of a server's models to work with. One server often holds several, and not all of them can hold a conversation:
 * a llama-swap or Ollama box usually lists an embedding model beside the chat model, and the list comes back in
 * alphabetical order, so "embed" is first. Setup used to offer the first name as the default. Enter saved an embedding
 * model, and every command after that failed.
 *
 * <p>The name only decides what is OFFERED first. Whether a model can chat is settled by asking it to (setup's one-word
 * test); a name is a guess, and it is used as one.
