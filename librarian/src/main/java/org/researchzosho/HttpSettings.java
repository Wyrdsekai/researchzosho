/**
 * The settings of java.net.http that every HTTP client in the process shares (the library has many: the model, the embeddings
 * server, web pages, feeds). They are read once, when the first connection is made, so they are set at the entry point before
 * anything connects.
 *
 * <p>llama.cpp's server, which {@code researchzosho model} runs, closes a keep-alive connection that has been idle for 5 seconds.
 * The JVM keeps a pooled connection for 20 minutes by default and reuses it, so a request sent at that moment went down a
 * connection the server was closing. Usually the request failed at once ("HTTP/1.1 header parser received no bytes"); through
 * Docker's port proxy, which {@code researchzosho model} publishes the server behind, the request was taken and the reply never
 * came, and the caller waited out its whole limit (CodeZaiku, 2026-10-06: 24 minutes, twice in forty calls; a soak test put every
 * such failure exactly 5 seconds after the previous reply). The pool now drops an idle connection after
 * {@value #KEEPALIVE_SECONDS} seconds, before the server does. A {@code -Djdk.httpclient.keepalive.timeout=} on the command line
 * wins. {@link Stopping#send} also sends a request once more when a pooled connection turns out to be dead.
