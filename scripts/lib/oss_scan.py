"""Privacy / secret scanner for the public open-source export.

Dependency-free on purpose: it must run on a fresh box with nothing but python3.
gitleaks/trufflehog are better at credential entropy — run them too if you have
them — but the highest-risk leak for THIS repo is not a stray AWS key. It is the
operator's infrastructure: machine names, absolute home paths, the layout of the
boxes the benchmarks ran on. No off-the-shelf scanner knows those.

It scans the EXPORT, not the source. Scanning the source would tell you what you
excluded; scanning the result tells you what you are about to publish.

Exit code 0 = clean, 1 = HIGH findings. Usage:

# be interpolated as the literal "__no_hosts_configured__", which compiled fine and matched
# nothing — so the export printed "0 HIGH" while the two rules that hunt machine names were
# inert. Silence from an unconfigured scanner is not evidence of cleanliness. Every unset
# key is recorded in UNCONFIGURED and main() refuses to report clean while any remain.
